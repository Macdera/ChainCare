# ChainCare 🩺🛡️

ChainCare is a **hybrid, pseudonymous, censorship-resistant health incident reporting platform** built on the **Solana blockchain**. It empowers everyday citizens and health workers to anonymously log public health issues (e.g., outbreaks, pollution, access problems), vote on priorities through a DAO mechanism, and drive data-informed policy and aid — without fear of censorship or retaliation.
